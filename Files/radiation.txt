    In 1932 the neutron was discovered by James Chadwick and, in 
1933, artificial radioactivity by Frderic and Irine Joliot-Curie. Thereafter, in the late 1930's and in the 1940's many artificially produced 
radioactive elements were discovered by many investigators using 
nuclear reactions produced in the cyclotron of Ernest Lawrence and 
the nuclear reactor developed by Enrico Fermi and his colleagues. In 
discussing such nuclear reactions the following designations are used: 
n for neutron, p for proton, d for deuteron, a for alpha particle, and y 
for gamma radiation, and the format, (n,y)
